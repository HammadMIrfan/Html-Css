    <!-- The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

        The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
        
        By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
        
        An unvisited link is underlined and blue
        A visited link is underlined and purple
        An active link is underlined and red -->

        <a href="Comments.html">Home</a>
