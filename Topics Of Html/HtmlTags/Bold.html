    <!-- HTML bold tag
HTML bold tag is represented by <b> tag.

HTML <b> tag is used to display the written text in bold format. It is strictly a presentational element. If you want to show your text in bold letters and not have real semantic meaning, then put it within <b>.......</b> tag.

Difference between HTML <b> and <strong> tag
The b tag is explicit whereas strong tag is semantic.The <strong> tag adds extra semantic meaning to the HTML document. -->
